# 🧙‍♂️ MLOps Wizardry
Welcome to MLOps Wizardry — my personal journey to mastering the craft of Machine Learning Operations.
This repository serves as both a living notebook of everything I learn and a portfolio of hands-on projects demonstrating real-world MLOps workflows.

From setting up reproducible ML pipelines to deploying, scaling, and monitoring models in production, this is where theory meets implementation.

# 🎯 Mission
To gain wizard-level proficiency in building, automating, and managing machine learning systems — making them reliable, scalable, and production-ready.

# Through this repository, I aim to:
📚 Document my learning of MLOps concepts, tools, and best practices
🛠 Showcase real implementations of pipelines, deployments, and monitoring setups
🚀 Build a foundation for becoming an industry-ready MLOps engineer
🤝 Share knowledge for anyone following a similar path

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies
